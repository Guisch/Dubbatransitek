If you would like to use Youtube, Soundcloud, Spotify or Deezer authentication, you will also need to register a new app on website, and rename /config/auth-default.js to /config/auth.js and edit the file with different key from

 - [Youtube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application)
 - [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/you/apps/new)
 - [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications/create)
 - [Deezer](http://developers.deezer.com/myapps/create)

If you would like to use similar song feature, you will also need a youtube (v2) and lastfm api key

 - [Lastfm](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create)
 - [Youtube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application)

### Installing dependencies

Simply clone the repo, then run

```
npm install
```

Then edit the config/database.js file to connect Dubbatransitek to your DB

### Run

Simply run

```
npm start
```

By default, it will use the environment variable PORT, or 8880 if there's nothing there.
